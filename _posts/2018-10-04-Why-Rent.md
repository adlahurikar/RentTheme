title: Why rent Equipments
---

Minimize investment and improve productivity by renting. Join movement by signing up,
and your business will change forever.
Grow your business by sharing. Economic growth depends on productivity and investment.

Traditional rental companies have always been in the business of helping contractors get the equipment they need without taking on the additional risk of owning that equipment. But avoiding a purchase is the only benefit, and rental companies can charge hefty premiums for specialty equipment – if they even have it. Sharing marketplaces make it easier to find specialized machines that project managers may not be able to get from a traditional rental company. By listing their equipment for rent on sharing marketplaces, equipment owners can connect with contractors who need access to a wider variety of equipment and charge their own “premium” to make money while equipment would otherwise sit idle.
